# Air Water and Land Surveillance Bot
The present project relates to robotics, and more particularly a robot capable of
maneuvering on multiple regions such as in the air, on the land and as well as on
water surface for purpose of surveillance, rescue, etc.

### Introduction
<p align="justify">
Many difficulties are faced in defence and research sector due to a lack of proper
system which can search, detect, and examine issues. These problems become
more complicated when they are spread across multiple dimensions. In defence
sector, accurate reconnaissance mission demands a system that has a capability of
manoeuvring in all the three dimensions (land, water and air). Similarly, in
research fields such as archaeology, mapping, surveillance etc. also needs the
system to research in different terrains. To solve these problems, we are proposing
a robot with competence of movement on land, water surface and in air. This
patent primarily details the designs of the mechanisms which are used to carry out
the above-mentioned operations. Secondarily, this patent describes electronics. All
the electronic components used are standard parts. The major contribution of this
patent is the novel mechanisms which allow the robot to perform motion in
multiple media.
The design we are proposing is a holonomic system made up of a spherical shell
which consists of all the components which are necessary for motion, mechanism
which are crucial for the actuation of motion giving elements. In addition to that
the invention also consists of the parts which are essential for the purpose of
surveillance and used for applications where robots with capability of motion in
multiple terrain is required such as narrow caves, high altitude etc. This multi
terrain robot surpasses the conventionally used robots by employing different
mechanisms. The development of multi-terrain robot is increasing rapidly nowadays for
applications in various fields such as in military use which includes surveillance,
mine detection, and sometimes used also as a weapon. Along with that the
application in the fields of space and planetary exploration such as in the testing
and detection of soil and the environment of planets, sample collection has
necessitated the use of such multi-terrain robot. Primitively researchers have
focussed on the design of robots having wheels for mobility, but wheeled robots
have difficulties in traversing through rough terrains, incapability of collecting
information about underwater activities and the design and material constraints
such as heat, chemicals etc which may damage the material of the wheels.
Drone surveillance is used to gain intelligence against enemy targets by
government agencies and against business competitors for high-level competitive
intelligence (CI) gathering. Other applications of drone surveillance include law
enforcement, private investigation, spying, disaster recovery, search and rescue,
drone journalism, photography, Lidar surveys and military reconnaissance. In the
case of military operations, surveillance drones may also be weaponized.

### Technical Description
<p align="justify">
  The present invention provides a spherical holonomic morphology that is formed
by the integration of mechanisms for mobility on various terrains and efficient
surveillance. The organization of the apparatus can be divided into several different
modules: The primary modules such as the land module, the flight module, water
module, and surveillance module along with all the secondary modules necessary
for the functioning of the primary modules.
The spherical shell of the apparatus is transparent allowing for the perception of
the surroundings using inbuilt cameras. The main advantage of spherical geometry
is it is free from non-holonomic constraints. The land module consists of two submodules, which controls the movement and
the rotational freedom of the robot. For linear motion, present invention proposed a
mechanism that comprises of arms contacting the inner surface of the sphere.
These arms are connected on the shafts of the motors that are further mounted on
the supporting plate. A third motor is mounted on other supporting plate. The
rotational module motor coincides with the vertical axis of the plate. The rotational
module motor consists of a momentum wheel. The reaction of this momentum
wheel provides for the change in the angular orientation of the robot and thereby
would be helpful in maneuvering the robot in various directions.
The flight module consisting of four Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) motors with
a gearbox mounted on it. Foldable propeller are mounted on the output shaft of the
gearbox. The function of the gearbox is to open the folded propeller during the flight mode and closing it during motion or floating mode. Non-folding propellers
occupy more space in the robot assembly thereby decreasing the compactness of
the robot; foldable propellers occupy half the space making the robot more
compact. The motors are mounted on links that are connected to an actuator using
a gear train. These links open and move out of the robot as the upper hemisphere is
raised which is possible using a rack and pinion mechanism.
The robot would remain floating on the water surface due to the buoyancy. The
land motion module would let the robot move on water surface.
