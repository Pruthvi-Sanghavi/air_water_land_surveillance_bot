# Air Water and Land Surveillance Robot
The present project relates to robotics, and more particularly a robot capable of
maneuvering on multiple regions such as in the air, on the land and as well as on
water surface for purpose of surveillance, rescue, etc.

Many difficulties are faced in defence and research sector due to a lack of proper
system which can search, detect, and examine issues. These problems become
more complicated when they are spread across multiple dimensions. In defence
sector, accurate reconnaissance mission demands a system that has a capability of
manoeuvring in all the three dimensions (land, water and air). Similarly, in
research fields such as archaeology, mapping, surveillance etc. also needs the
system to research in different terrains. To solve these problems, we are proposing
a robot with competence of movement on land, water surface and in air. This
patent primarily details the designs of the mechanisms which are used to carry out
the above-mentioned operations. Secondarily, this patent describes electronics. All
the electronic components used are standard parts. The major contribution of this
patent is the novel mechanisms which allow the robot to perform motion in
multiple media.
The design we are proposing is a holonomic system made up of a spherical shell
which consists of all the components which are necessary for motion, mechanism
which are crucial for the actuation of motion giving elements. In addition to that
the invention also consists of the parts which are essential for the purpose of
surveillance and used for applications where robots with capability of motion in
multiple terrain is required such as narrow caves, high altitude etc. This multi
terrain robot surpasses the conventionally used robots by employing different
mechanisms. The development of multi-terrain robot is increasing rapidly nowadays for
applications in various fields such as in military use which includes surveillance,
mine detection, and sometimes used also as a weapon. Along with that the
application in the fields of space and planetary exploration such as in the testing
and detection of soil and the environment of planets, sample collection has
necessitated the use of such multi-terrain robot. Primitively researchers have
focussed on the design of robots having wheels for mobility, but wheeled robots
have difficulties in traversing through rough terrains, incapability of collecting
information about underwater activities and the design and material constraints
such as heat, chemicals etc which may damage the material of the wheels.
Drone surveillance is used to gain intelligence against enemy targets by
government agencies and against business competitors for high-level competitive
intelligence (CI) gathering. Other applications of drone surveillance include law
enforcement, private investigation, spying, disaster recovery, search and rescue,
drone journalism, photography, Lidar surveys and military reconnaissance. In the
case of military operations, surveillance drones may also be weaponized.
